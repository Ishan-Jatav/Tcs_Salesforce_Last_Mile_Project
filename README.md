# Tcs_Salesforce_Last_Mile_ProjectProject Title:

##SmartRecruit – Salesforce-powered Job Application Tracking System

- Industry:

##Human Resources / Recruitment

## Project Type:

B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation (internal use for HR & Recruiters)

## Target Users:

HR Managers → Create job postings, oversee the hiring pipeline

Recruiters → Shortlist, schedule interviews, manage candidates

Candidates → Submit job applications (via web form, LinkedIn, or referrals)

## Problem Statement

In many organizations (including IT service companies like TCS), the recruitment process is fragmented:

Job openings are created manually in spreadsheets

Applications are collected via emails or job portals

Recruiters lose track of candidate stages (shortlisted, interviewed, rejected, offered)

Communication with candidates (emails, updates) is delayed and inconsistent

HR leadership lacks real-time dashboards to monitor hiring efficiency

This causes delayed hiring, poor candidate experience, and reduced recruiter productivity.

## To address this, we propose implementing a Salesforce-based ATS to centralize recruitment: from job posting → application tracking → interview → offer → closure.

## Core Use Cases
1. Job Posting Management

HR creates job postings (Job Title, Department, Skills Required, Experience, Location, Deadline).

Jobs can be published internally or externally (future integration with portals like LinkedIn).

2. Candidate & Application Management

Candidates submit applications (via web form / imported by recruiter).

Candidate object stores personal details, resume, experience, and skills.

Applications are automatically linked to the respective Job Posting.

3. Recruitment Workflow

Application → Shortlist → Interview → Offer → Hired/Rejected

Automated Flows/Approvals move the application through each stage.

Recruiters get task assignments when a candidate moves forward.

4. Notifications & Communication

Automatic email/SMS alerts to candidates (e.g., “Shortlisted for Interview”, “Application Rejected”, “Offer Released”).

Recruiters notified when candidates update status or submit missing docs.

5. Interview Scheduling

Recruiters schedule interviews using Salesforce Calendar / custom objects.

Candidate + Interviewer get confirmation emails.

6. Analytics & Dashboards

Recruitment Funnel Dashboard → Number of Applications → Shortlisted → Interviewed → Offers → Hired.

Recruiter Performance Dashboard → Applications handled, interview-to-offer ratio, closure rate.

HR Manager Dashboard → Hiring trends by department/location.
